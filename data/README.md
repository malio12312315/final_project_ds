# Data Description: IMDB popular movies data


I use the `IMDB_movies.csv` dataset available at 
<https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/IMDB_movies.csv>

This dataset includes information of popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years. 

The data fields included are: Title, Genre, Description, Director, Actors, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue, Metascore (score of the movie on the metacritic website)
